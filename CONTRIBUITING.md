# Contributing to StimOn-StimOff_Cognition

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this repository, which provides code reproducing analyses from our "Switching off subthalamic deep brain stimulation in Parkinson’s disease
worsens reaction time and executive function independent of motor effects" paper . We welcome contributions that enhance reproducibility, fix bugs, improve documentation, or extend analysis while maintaining scientific accuracy.

## Code of Conduct
This project follows the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/). By participating, you agree to uphold it.[web:11]

## Suggested Contributions
- Bug reports in analysis scripts or data processing 
- Documentation improvements for reproducibility
- New tests ensuring results match published paper figures/tables
- Performance optimizations without altering scientific outputs

Contributions altering core results or introducing unvalidated methods require discussion first.

## How to Contribute
1. **Check open issues**
2. **Fork the repo** and clone locally: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git`.
3. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name` (reference paper section if relevant).
4. **Install dependencies**: Use `environment.yml` or `requirements.txt`; prefer conda for reproducibility in biomedical research.
5. **Make changes**: Follow style guidelines below; preserve exact outputs from original analyses.
6. **Test thoroughly**: Run full pipeline; new tests must pass and match paper results (e.g., via pytest).
7. **Commit and push**: Use clear messages and descriptions
8. **Open a Pull Request**: Link to related issue/paper section; include before/after results.

## Style Guidelines
- **Code**: PEP 8 for Python; use type hints; avoid changes to core analysis logic.
- **Documentation**: Update README/ notebooks with any changes; cite paper sections.
- **Data**: Never commit sensitive medical data; use synthetic/public datasets only.
- **Ethics**: Flag potential biases and comply with DSGVO
